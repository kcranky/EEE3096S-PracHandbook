\section*{Introduction}
This lab handbook serves as a side-by-side reference manual for you to use in your laboratory sessions. Not all information is included here (we expect you do to some research of your own) but it is a good starting point. It also includes some additional information you may find useful as you use the Raspberry Pi for your own projects.

This handbook covers a range of topics from installation, to cross compilation, to some more advanced topics such as networking. There are links to useful learning resources, as well as some quick reference guides for you to refer back to as you work through all your practicals.

The hope is that once the course is complete, you can hold on to this manual and use it for any other Raspberry Pi related projects you may choose to undertake. 

While all efforts were made to ensure that this manual is correct and accurate, it is quite possible that errors have been made. Please email any errors you find to the TA.
